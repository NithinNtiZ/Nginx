# server_tokens off;:
# This directive turns off the nginx version number in error messages and the "Server" response header field, which could potentially expose information about your server's software. It's a security best practice to minimize the amount of information you expose about your server to potential attackers.

# more_clear_headers Server;: 
# This directive clears the "Server" header in HTTP responses. Even though you've already disabled it with server_tokens off;, this directive ensures that any modules that might add the "Server" header are overridden, further preventing information leakage.

# add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;: 
# This header defines a Content Security Policy (CSP) for your website. CSP is a security feature that helps prevent various types of attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. In this specific example, the CSP allows content to be loaded only from the same origin as the website itself ('self'). This means that resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) can only be loaded from the same domain as the website.

# add_header X-Frame-Options "deny" always;: 
# This header prevents your web pages from being displayed in a frame or iframe, which helps mitigate clickjacking attacks. By setting it to "deny", you're instructing browsers not to display your content in any frame, regardless of the site attempting to embed it.

# add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;: 
# This header prevents Google Chrome and Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type. This can reduce the risk of certain types of web attacks, such as MIME confusion attacks.

# proxy_hide_header X-Runtime;: 
# This directive hides the "X-Runtime" header in responses. This header is typically added by Ruby on Rails applications and indicates the time taken by the server to process the request. Hiding it can be considered a security best practice to limit the exposure of server internals.

# proxy_hide_header X-powered-by;: 
# This directive hides the "X-Powered-By" header in responses. This header often indicates the technology (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET, etc.) used by the server to generate the response. Hiding it can help prevent attackers from identifying potential vulnerabilities specific to the server technology being used.


# Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
# This header specifies which origins are allowed to access the resources of the server. In this case, it's set to 'https://example.com', meaning that only requests originating from https://example.com are permitted. You can also set it to '*' to allow requests from any origin, but this is less secure.

# Access-Control-Allow-Methods:
# This header specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resource. In this example, it allows GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods. These are common methods used in web requests for retrieving data (GET), submitting data (POST), and checking server capabilities (OPTIONS).

# Access-Control-Allow-Headers:
# This header specifies which HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request. It helps to control which headers are allowed to be sent along with the request. In this example, it includes several common headers like DNT, User-Agent, X-Requested-With, etc. This list should be adjusted based on the specific headers your application requires.

# Access-Control-Max-Age:
# This header specifies how long (in seconds) the results of a preflight request (the request made by the browser to ask the server for permission to send the actual request) can be cached. A preflight request is made using the HTTP OPTIONS method before the actual request is sent. Setting a max age helps to reduce the number of preflight requests. In this example, it's set to 1728000 seconds (20 days).

# Content-Type:
# This header specifies the media type of the resource being sent to the client. In this case, it's set to text/plain; charset=utf-8, indicating that the content being sent is plain text encoded in UTF-8 character encoding.

# Content-Length:
# This header specifies the length of the response body in bytes. In this example, it's set to 0, indicating that the response body is empty. This is often used with responses that don't have a body but still require headers to be sent, like in the case of a successful preflight request.
